# .nvmrc Configuration File
####################################################
# Purpose:
# The .nvmrc file is used with Node Version Manager (NVM) to specify
# the required version of Node.js for this project. By defining the
# Node.js version, all developers and environments will use the same
# version, ensuring consistency and preventing issues caused by version
# mismatches during development or deployment.

# NODE VERSION SPECIFICATION
####################################################
# This file specifies the Node.js version to be used throughout the
# project. Using a consistent version helps to:
# - Avoid errors due to incompatible Node.js versions during development.
# - Ensure dependencies are installed and run as expected.
# - Guarantee predictable behavior across development, testing, and deployment.

# Recommended Usage:
# - Run `nvm use` in the project directory to switch to the specified version.
# - If the required Node.js version is not installed, use `nvm install`
#   followed by `nvm use` to set up the correct version.

# Node.js version required for this project.
